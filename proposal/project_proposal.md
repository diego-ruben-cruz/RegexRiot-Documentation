## Abstract

Regular expressions are an essential tool for developers working with text data. However, constructing regular expressions can be a tedious and error-prone task. To make this process easier for Java and Kotlin developers, we propose the development of a Java library called RegexRiot. This library will provide a simple and intuitive way of constructing regular expressions by using a chain of function calls that describe the pattern to match. Similar projects exist for JavaScript, but there is a lack of such libraries for Java and Kotlin. This project aims to fill that gap and provide a solution for developers working with Java and Kotlin.

## Body of Proposed Work

The proposed work involves developing a Java library called RegexRiot, which will provide a simple and intuitive way of constructing regular expressions. The library will be designed to be easy to use and will provide a wide range of functionalities for pattern matching. The following are the key features of the library:

1. Chain of function calls: The library will provide a chain of function calls that will allow developers to construct regular expressions by describing the pattern they want to match. This approach will make it easy for developers to create complex regular expressions without the need for extensive knowledge of the underlying syntax.
2. Intuitive syntax: The library will use an intuitive syntax that will make it easy for developers to understand and use regular expressions. The syntax will be designed to be easy to read and will provide a clear description of the pattern to match.
3. Support for Java and Kotlin: The library will be developed for Java and Kotlin developers. This will provide a solution for developers working with these languages who are looking for an easy-to-use regular expression library.
4. Wide range of functionalities: The library will provide a wide range of functionalities for pattern matching, including capturing groups, non-capturing groups, character classes, quantifiers, and more. This will provide developers with a powerful tool for working with text data.

The development of the library will involve the following steps:

1. Research: The first step will be to research existing regular expression libraries for Java and Kotlin. This will help us identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing solutions and provide insights into what functionalities are most needed by developers.
2. Design: Based on our research, we will design the library, including the syntax and chain of function calls. We will also identify the key functionalities that the library will provide.
3. Implementation: Once we have designed the library, we will implement it in Java and Kotlin. We will use test-driven development to ensure that the library is robust and free of bugs.
4. Documentation: We will provide comprehensive documentation for the library, including usage examples and a user manual. This will help developers understand how to use the library and make the most of its functionalities.
5. Release: Once the library is complete, we will release it to the Java and Kotlin communities. We will also promote it on social media and developer forums to ensure that it reaches a wide audience.
